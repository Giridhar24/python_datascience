# Concept of the Day: A/B Testing
# Explanation: A/B Testing is the "Gold Standard" for proving causality (Cause and Effect) in product and science.
# Split: Randomly split users into two groups.
# Control Group (A): Sees the current version (e.g., Blue Button).
# Treatment Group (B): Sees the new version (e.g., Red Button).
# Measure: Compare the conversion rate (e.g., clicks) between A and B.
# Test: Use the "p-value" (learned yesterday) to see if the difference is real or just luck.
# Why Random? Randomization ensures that the only difference between Group A and Group B is the button color, not age, location, or time of day.
