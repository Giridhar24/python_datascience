# Concept of the Day: The Bias-Variance Tradeoff
# Explanation: This is the central problem in Machine Learning.
# Bias (Underfitting): The model is too simple. It misses the target entirely. (Like shooting a cannonball; consistent but inaccurate).
# Variance (Overfitting): The model is too sensitive. It hits all over the place depending on the specific training data. (Like shooting a machine gun with shaky hands).
# The Goal: Low Bias AND Low Variance. We achieve this by adding more data or "Regularization" (penalizing complexity).
